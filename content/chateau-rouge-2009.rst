Video Installation in collaboration with `Collectif
Coin <http://www.collectif-coin.com>`__ from Grenoble (F) for the "Nuit
Blanche 2009" of the art venue `Chateau
Rouge <http://www.chateau-rouge.net>`__ in Annemasse (F).

This installation was an attempt to explore a feeling of distance
between the viewer and its own image in relation to the particular
notion of time we have when confronted with our own image: a mix of
vertigo and fuzziness depicted by the chaotic montage of present and
past captured images of the event.
