What we perceive constructs us. We are what we feel, what we see, what we hear. But perception is not a faculty per se, it is printed from what we are.. our observation point is localised by our own body, which, just by filling a volume, might influence the observation itself... so the question loops and never ends. This mere question is endless and simply virtiginuous. We have no aim to answer it, just the desire to explore the complexity of the imbrication. The <em>objectivity</em> of the camera will not overcome the ambiguity of perception. However, we consider the camera as a tool for exploring what we may perceive, a window opened on our subconscience.
