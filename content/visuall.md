[V-Atlas](http://www.visuall-tek.org/en/v-atlas/) is part of [VISUALL-tek](http://www.visuall-tek.org/en/), a library of innovative and collaborative apps dedicated to visual studies.
Spatialize, explore, query, recompose: 4 verbs to summarize the path proposed by V-Atlas (Video Analysis TooL Assisted by Slitscan). Whether alone or in a group, each person can identify, classify, categorize iconographic and narrative patterns in a set of still or moving images.
A slitscan process is exploited to cut the corpus and find its way into the temporality of the visual archive which is consulted.
