In October 2016 was held the 50th anniversary of the <i><b>9 evenings</b></i>, an emblematic event of October 1966 in New York consisting of a series of 9 performances
combining visual arts, dance, theater, music, and video, led by 10 artists in close collaboration with thirty engineers from Bell Telephone Laboratories.
Taken advantage of this anniversary, we decided to structure an Art / Sciences-Technologies approach in the North of France and in Belgium in order to bring visibility
to the actions undertaken and to bring out other initiatives.
