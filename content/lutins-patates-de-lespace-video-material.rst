A video has been produced for the post-rock band `Les Lutins Patates de
l'Espace <https://myspace.com/leslutinspatatesdelespace>`__ and has been used for their
2009-2010 tour as video material for the track "Set - Part 2" (listen
`here <https://myspace.com/leslutinspatatesdelespace/music/song/set-part-2-40550885-43057125>`__).
This video is a kind of anachronistic encounter between the joyfull mix
of electro-post rock of LPE and the DIY avant-garde poetry of Melies and
his "A Trip to the Moon"...
