*L'Etranger* is based on a poem by Charles Beaudelaire (in "Le Spleen de
Paris"). The literary composition can be seen as portraying personal and
specific feelings that can be perceived by anyone who has the sensation
of not belonging to his or her environment. The video proposes a
representation of these particular impressions. Credits : Sound take,
advisor : Peter Romich Below is the text of the poem : L' Etranger (The
Stranger) - Tell me, enigmatic man, whom do you love the best? Your
father, or your mother, or your sister, or your brother? - I have
neither father, nor mother, nor sister, nor brother. - Your friends? -
You are using a word whose meaning remains unknown to me to this very
day. - Your country? - I do not know under what latitude it lies. -
Beauty? - I would love her gladly, goddess and immortal. - Gold? - I
hate it as much as you hate God. - Well then! What do you love,
extraordinary stranger? - I love the clouds ... the passing clouds ...
over there ... over there ... the marvelous clouds!
