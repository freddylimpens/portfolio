Christmas is probably one of the most popular christian celebration. It
is a significant point for our temporality, the time position where the
circle had done a lap. It "synchronises" : people gather, offer -- and
hope for -- gifts, remember their former christmas, etc. at the same
time.This synchronisation is moreover "forced" by economical interests
which fake to serve this tradition. Christmas has an ambivalent nature:
it is as well a cheerful event differently experienced by each of us and
a tradition which reveals a gregarian force.
