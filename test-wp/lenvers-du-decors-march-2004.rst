This work was a response to a competition organized by a theatre
festival and called "Behind the set". we investigate here the
possibility to perceive our environment by trying to "listen and see"
what can be hidden behind the first appearance of things. This
preparation of a meal in a university restaurant can also be seen as "a
show", but overall, a sensible approach can find the poetry that lies
under its daily repetition.
