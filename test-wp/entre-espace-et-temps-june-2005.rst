Entre Espace & Temps (Between Space and Time) aims at underlining
subjectivity of reality. Surroundings are usually arbitrary discribed as
space and time. However human perception is unable to rely on these
"four dimensions" and constructs specific view of his environment, a
complex feature which is not simply based on physics laws. It is an in
between, something which escapes sometimes from the logical system and
relies more on personal sensibility. Between Space and Time as an other
dimension experimented by us everywhere and at every time.
