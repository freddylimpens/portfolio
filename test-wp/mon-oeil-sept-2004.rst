       This short film is an attempt to realize a "filmed reflection"
about the topic of "journey" in both its physical and mental sense. It
consists in an editing of images shot in the station of Brescia, Italy,
and during our trip. A station can be seen as a place where a tension
occurs, between confrontation with many people and introspection in our
own world. The camera, that symbolizes our own perception, is an
exploration tool of this interstice between us and the world, and
between us and these persons seized in this intern effervescence and
that we try to understand thanks to our own mental fictions.
