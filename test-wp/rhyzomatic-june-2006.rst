The symbolic consists precisely in breaching the univocality of the
"message", in restoring the ambivalence of meaning and in demolishing in
the same stroke the agency of code." Jean Baudrillard, Requiem for the
media. This piece is an attempt to explore this ambivalence of meaning
that any "temporal object" can draw. A set of interconnexions is
established between texts and video footages in a many-to-many fashion.
Then a custom software builds up a continuous flux, making his own path
through this web of "inter-projections".
