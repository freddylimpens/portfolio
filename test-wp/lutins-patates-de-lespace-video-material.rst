A video has been produced for the post-rock band `Les Lutins Patates de
l'Espace <http://www.patateland.com/>`__ and has been used for their
2009-2010 tour as video material for the track "Set - Part 2" (listen
`here <http://www.patateland.com/kill-me-when-im-dead/player.html>`__).
This video is a kind of anachronistic encounter between the joyfull mix
of electro-post rock of LPE and the DIY avant-garde poetry of Melies and
his "A Trip to the Moon"...
